# Bulletline Theme
An agnoster and bullettrain inspired theme for ZSH

# README
In order for this theme to render correctly, you will need a [Powerline-patched font](https://github.com/Lokaltog/powerline-fonts).
Make sure you have a recent version: the code points that Powerline uses changed in 2012, and older versions will display incorrectly, in confusing ways.

In addition, I recommend the
[Solarized theme](https://github.com/altercation/solarized/) and, if you're
using it on Mac OS X, [iTerm 2](http://www.iterm2.com/) over Terminal.app -
it has significantly better color fidelity.

# Credit
Credit should go to Agnoster mod and https://github.com/caiogondim for the hard work.
